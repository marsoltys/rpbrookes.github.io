# Welcome!

You've reached the GitHub repository of Ryan Brookes - what a time to be alive.

## About Me

I'm a software engineer for BT and programming enthusiast. I am trying to study in my free time so I can improve my game during paid time. Whether that's working remains to be seen...

## Projects

So far, I've worked on:

* ImageJ/Leap Motion: Yet to upload work in this area but it was done as part of my dissertation
* My super basic front page, which is just a playground for me to try front-end technologies: rpbrookes.github.io

## Reach Me

If you have any questions about my work or want to get in touch, my handle is @rpbrookes.
